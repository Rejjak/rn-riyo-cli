RN RIYO CLI is a development tool for React Native app development.

# Features

- Generates standard project structure and navigation based on type: `sidebar`, `tabbar`, or `basic`.
- Implements optimized routing configuration.
- Easily manage application package name and app name. Developers can change the Android package name and app name without modifying specific files.
- Generates a keystore file and automatically configures it with React Native. No manual changes needed.
- Automatically imports new screens into the navigation configuration file when generated.
- Generates a corresponding style file for each new screen, imported with common code.
- Allows generation of individual files, such as components, styles, and services as needed.
- Saves developers time by creating new applications with a well-structured project setup.

# What's New in the Latest Version
- Added Facebook integration functionality with a single command. Easily set up Facebook integration for both Android and iOS platforms. No need to follow lengthy documentationâ€”a demo example is generated in your project directory after running this command.

```sh
rn-riyo setup-facebook your_facebook_app_id
```
